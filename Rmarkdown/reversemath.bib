	abstract = {The present work investigates inductive inference from the perspective of reverse mathematics. Reverse mathematics is a framework that allows gauging the proof strength of theorems and axioms in many areas of mathematics. The present work applies its methods to basic notions of algorithmic learning theory such as Angluin's tell-tale criterion and its variants for learning in the limit and for conservative learning, as well as to the more general scenario of partial learning. These notions are studied in the reverse mathematics context for uniformly and weakly represented families of languages. The results are stated in terms of axioms referring to induction strength and to domination of weakly represented families of functions.},

	abstract = {We analyze the logical strength of theorems on marriage problems with a fixed finite number of solutions via the techniques of reverse mathematics. We show that if a marriage problem has k solutions, then there is a finite set of boys such that the marriage problem restricted to this set has exactly k solutions, each of which extend uniquely to a solution of the original marriage problem. The strength of this assertion depends on whether or not the marriage problem has a bounding function. We also answer three questions from our previous work on marriage problems with unique solutions.},
